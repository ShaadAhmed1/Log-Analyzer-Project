Project Progress Log

August 19, 2025
Accomplished:
    * Set up the development environment (installed Python, pandas, and other libraries).
    * Wrote the initial script to parse the Apache log file using `re` and `pandas`.
    * Successfully read and structured the sample log data into a DataFrame.

Next Steps:
    * Begin writing the functions to detect suspicious patterns (scanning, brute-force, DoS).
    * Test the detection logic to ensure it works correctly.
